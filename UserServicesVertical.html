          A vertical garden is also referred to as a green wall or living wall. Living walls are self sufficient vertical gardens that are attached to exterior or interior walls of a building. They differ from green façades (e.g. ivy walls) in that the plants are rooted in a structural support which is fixed to the wall itself. The plants receive water and nutrients from within the vertical support instead of from the ground.<br> 
In vertical gardens, various types of modular panels can be used along with geotextile fabrics, growing media, irrigation systems, and plants.<br><br>
<p>Living walls are particularly suitable for cities, as they allow good use of available vertical surface areas. The living wall could also function for urban agriculture, urban gardening, or for its beauty as art.</p>
<b>Benefits</b><br><br>
•	Aesthetics:<br>
<p>Green walls combine the works of art by nature in different ways as there are numerous varieties of plants that can be used in different combinations.</p><br>
•	Indoor Air Quality:<br>
<p>It is well established that plants can purify air. Along with indoor potted plants, green walls go a long way in improving indoor air quality.</p><br>
•	Health And Wellness:<br>
<p>Living in urban environments, we are surrounded by concrete, traffic, noise and pollution. It has a profound impact on our physical and mental wellness. Greenery softens this hard environment, acting as a tonic to ease stress and fatigue.</p>

<br><br>
<b>Installation</b><br><br>
<p>Ideally the selected plants are planted into the modules or pots and are allowed to settle and grow over a period, before installation on site. Watering can be done manually or through irrigation systems which can be installed along with the living wall structure. These living wall structures can be fixed directly to existing walls or can be fixed on to a MS framework in case of free standing living walls.</p>
<br><br>
